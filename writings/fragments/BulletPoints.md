### The power of the web

Being built on the web means you can leverage all the tools built on the web. Can you say Developer Toolbar?

### Version Control

A simple XML format means versioning is a breeze. Just put your project into git and let it handle the rest.

### Symbols

Symbols are a powerful method for organzing graphical assets. Combine them with CSS and you can automatically keep your
resources up to date and exported in the formats you need.

### Node Based Image Editing

Editing shouldn't destroy your images. Sqircle leverages the power of GEGL to bring node based non-destructive effects.
Effects ranging from gaussian blur to Sharpen.

### Same tools different canvases

You shouldn't have to swap between vector brush and bitmap brush the tool should be smart enough to figure out.
When you draw on vector canvas you'll be drawing SVG. When you drawn on HTML you'll create canvas elements. Draw on an image and you'll create bitmaps.

### Swappable brush engines

You shouldn't be limited to one brush engine. Brush formats should be indepdnet from them.
