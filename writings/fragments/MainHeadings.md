# The Web Meets Graphics App

Today we design only in approximations. Designs only become real once they are converted, exported and ported. Designs cry out to be real, to be playable, to be malleable. To be tangible. 

Our tools today don't let us play with our designs and our designs suffer because of it. Sqircle changes the paradigm. 
Sqircle seamlessly merges the web with the tools of a graphics editor. You don't code first. You don't design first. You create first.
